## [&#128279;](#what-is-awayto) What is Awayto?

Awayto generates self-hosted web applications with built-in infrastructure and components to support groups or organizations which require scheduling, communications, reporting, and related functionality. Collaborative multi-modal features (voice/video/chat/docs) are positioned within a robust collection of operations-driven functionality (users/groups/roles/services/scheduling/surveying/reporting). Many founding principles of the platform were derived from previous experience developing and extending an online writing center. However, Awayto is built to be generic-purpose and enable the development of any kind of online platform with multi-modal needs.

For developers, Awayto is based around some core ideas:

- Enhance the developer experience
- Provide opportunities for developers to learn
- Minimal focus on deployment
- Use conventions that compliment functionality

There is a great deal of functionality threaded throughout the platform created purely to enhance the developer's experience. Most abstractions are planned and designed to be extended. Core systems at both the application layer, like the API, or the development layer, like the CLI, can be added to or modified with very little effort. And with the use of Typescript throughout the application, we are able to utilize a single layer of types, unifying the stack in a lot of cases.

Awayto is opinionated software. For the most part an experienced developer will be familiar with the concepts used throughout the system, although some things are homebrew. Awayto was created from a desire to share "a way to develop." This "way" is largely governed by the software, abstractions and conventions used. The closer you follow the information in this guide and code patterns presented, the faster and more effective you will become within the platform's ecosystem. Adding new features across the stack is generally a matter of implementing pre-existing, highly-configurable structures. This is your favorite blogpress software, but with code, and for web application developers.
