/**
 * `useComponents` takes advantage of [React.lazy](https://reactjs.org/docs/code-splitting.html#reactlazy) as well as the [Proxy API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Proxy). By combining these functionalities, we end up with a tool that seamlessly meshes with expanding and changing codebases.
 * 
 * As new files are added to the project while the developer is working, they will be automatically discovered and made lazily available through `useComponents`. The only need is to refresh the browser page once the component has been added to the render cycle.
 * 
 * ```
 * import { useComponents } from 'awayto';
 * 
 * const { NewDevelopmentComponent } = useComponents();
 * 
 * render <NewDevelopmentComponent {...props} />;
 * ```
