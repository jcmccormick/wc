## [Basic Concepts](#basic-concepts)

Awayto is for those seeking a web platform containing many features out of the box which can be further built upon. The core of the project was developed by a single person, with the intention of simplifying development and making constructs to enhance development. With much of the foundational decisions having already been made, there is a clear path to extremely fast feature development.

It is assumed the developer is familiar with common web technologies like APIs and databases, as well as being proficient in Typescript and shell. One key goal of Awayto is to offer a fully featured development environment that can be easily tinkered with and controlled via configuration and scripting. A basic CLI is provided to run commands, from first time setup to deploying, building, and scaling resources locally or in the cloud. 

This guide is intended to expose you to all the custom concepts used in Awayto. It is a system comprised of many technologies, and hopefully you will find the abstractions used to be helpful and assertive. Here we discuss those abstractions, how to use them, and their purpose in the greater scheme of web application development.
