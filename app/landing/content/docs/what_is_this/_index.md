## What is Awayto?

Awayto is a web application generator built with Typescript. It stands out as a highly-opinionated online multi-modal collaboration platform. Many of the design choices and architecture underlying the system were founded in the construction of an online writing center. However, Awayto is built as generic purpose and allows for the quick and easy development of other communications-related applications.

Developmentally, Awayto is based around some core ideas:

- Enhance the developer experience
- Provide opportunities for developers to learn
- Minimal focus on deployment, managed centrally
- Use conventions that compliment functionality

There is a great deal of functionality threaded throughout the platform created purely to enhance the developer's experience. And to further increase time effectiveness, most abstractions are planned and designed to be extended. Core systems at both the application layer, like the API, or the development layer, like the CLI, can be added to or modified with very little effort. And with the use of Typescript throughout the platform, we are able to utilize a single layer of types, unifying the front and back ends.

Awayto is opinionated. Heavily. For the most part, an experienced developer will be familiar with the concepts in play throughout the system. Although some things are home brew. The theme of this software is "a way to develop," and this "way" is largely governed by the abstractions we use. The closer you adhere to, for example, the information you read in this guide, and the many code samples you see throughout the codebase, the faster and more effective you will become. A full stack feature implementation takes minutes.
