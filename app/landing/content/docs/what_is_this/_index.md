## [What is Awayto?](#what-is-awayto)

Awayto is a web application generator built with Typescript. It stands out as a highly-opinionated online multi-modal collaboration platform. Many of the design choices and architecture underlying the system were founded in the construction of an online writing center. However, Awayto is built as generic purpose and allows for the quick and easy development of other communications-related applications.

Developmentally, Awayto is based around some core ideas:

- Enhance the developer experience
- Provide opportunities for developers to learn
- Minimal focus on deployment, managed centrally
- Use conventions that compliment functionality

There is a great deal of functionality threaded throughout the platform created purely to enhance the developer's experience. Most abstractions are planned and designed to be extended. Core systems at both the application layer, like the API, or the development layer, like the CLI, can be added to or modified with very little effort. And with the use of Typescript throughout the application, we are able to utilize a single layer of types, unifying the stack in a lot of cases.

Awayto is opinionated software. For the most part an experienced developer will be familiar with the concepts used throughout the system, although some things are homebrew. Awayto is "a way to develop" and this "way" is largely governed by the abstractions we use. The closer you follow the information in this guide and code patterns presented, the faster and more effective you will become. Adding new features across the stack is a matter of implementing pre-existing structures. Conventions are used everywhere and anywhere. This is your favorite drag-n-drop blog software, but with code, and for developers (and no drag-n-drop).
