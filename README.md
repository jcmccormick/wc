Thanks for checking this out. It's bare bones right now as we're still in active development.

The general idea is we're building a platform that developers can use to generate their own applications that are rich in features, easy to configure and manage, and allow for total control of the stack.

Generated text: This kubernetes cluster hosts multiple applications including a web application built on typescript, cra, react, nginx, a keycloak server for authentication, a websocket server, a postgres database, an express server api using openid and passport for keycloak auth. Additionally, a STUN/TURN server for WebRTC, MongoDB, Elasticsearch and Graylog for logging, are hosted.

We're using the concept of an online writing center to elicit the type of functionality we desire in the base product. Ultimately what gets deployed is a group-based saas platform that comes with users/group/role/service/schedule/appointment/reporting controls out of the box in a generic way that lets developers start building custom features.

We'll be coming to a stable version within a couple months, and will be offering trial-period testing accounts for any who are interested. But we're also working on [WizApp](https://github.com/keybittech/wizapp), an AI-powered Typescript project assistant integrated with GitHub. So if that's of any interest please do check it out! And if you came to here from there, many thanks!
