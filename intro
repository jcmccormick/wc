Awayto.Exchange is a new website where businesses are able to have their users schedule specific times to receive service, which could be any given service that the business offers. For example if, it was a lawncare service, the homeowner would come to the site to schedule a time for the maintenance crew to come. Alternatively, a consultation service can utilize features of the site to meet their consultees in an online audio/visual chatroom, which features document sharing, real time transcriptions, interactive resource viewing and editing, and other things. Any company could use this platform as long as they offer some kind of service to their users, and that service needs to be scheduled for a specific time. Multiple services can be offered by the same business, for example a learning center which offers reading or writing or math tutoring as three different services. The business is assumed have a group of employees who have various roles and are able to perform different functions in the site such as: creating forms for users to fill out when they submit appointments; schedule their own time to work on a calendar that supports monthly, weekly, and daily schedules, such as 40 hours per week versus booking the entire day, for a handful of days during the month; and view data about the sessions they have with the users of the service. Administrators have complete control over the roles and actions that users can take, with updates persisting across the system to all logged in users within 1 minute.

When users visit the site for the very first time, they need to either create a group, or join a group. Create a friendly, short welcome message that we can put on the onboarding page to give the gist of the website, and what information we need right now.
