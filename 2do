TWO PATHS


#1 - i'm creating a writing center to derive functionality

#2 - i'm creating a generic web application generation framework


Can I allow my users to vote on the next thing to be developed?

- limitations, (cant vote on next if voted) (2 week polling)
- expectations, (functionality must be generic)
